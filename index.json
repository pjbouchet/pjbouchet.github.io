While important progress in this field has been made in the past decade, there has been no coherent prioritisation of key research questions to help set the future research agenda for seascape ecology. We used a 2-stage modified Delphi method to solicit applied research questions from academic experts in seascape ecology and then asked respondents to identify priority questions across 9 interrelated research themes using 2 rounds of selection. We also invited senior management/conservation practitioners to prioritise the same research questions. Analyses highlighted congruence and discrepancies in perceived priorities for applied research. Themes related to both ecological concepts and management practice, and those identified as priorities include seascape change, seascape connectivity, spatial and temporal scale, ecosystem-based management, and emerging technologies and metrics. Highest-priority questions (upper tercile) received 50% agreement between respondent groups, and lowest priorities (lower tercile) received 58% agreement. Across all 3 priority tiers, 36 of the 55 questions were within a ±10% band of agreement. We present the most important applied research questions as determined by the proportion of votes received. For each theme, we provide a synthesis of the research challenges and the potential role of seascape ecology. These priority questions and themes serve as a roadmap for advancing applied seascape ecology during, and beyond, the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).","tags":["Ecology"],"title":"Seascape ecology: identifying research priorities for an emerging ocean sustainability science","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614902400,"objectID":"a9a444261e6d87c7224505e18953dff5","permalink":"/publication/23-2020-forrest-ecosphere/","publishdate":"2021-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/23-2020-forrest-ecosphere/","section":"publication","summary":"In coastal systems, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been shown to increase the diversity, abundance, and biomass of wildlife assemblages as well as their resilience to climate change. The effectiveness of pelagic MPAs is less clear, with arguments against their establishment typically based on the highly mobile nature of pelagic taxa. We used mid-water stereo-baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS) and spatial predictive models to characterise the pelagic wildlife assemblage at the head of the Perth Canyon, one of the largest submarine canyons in Australia, over a 7-year period (2013–2019). The total number of unique taxa and mean values of taxonomic richness, abundance, fork length and biomass demonstrated strong interannual stability, although mean taxonomic richness and abundance were significantly lower in 2018 relative to other years. Seasonal variability was absent in 2016, but in 2018, taxonomic richness and abundance were three times greater in the Austral spring than in the autumn. Some mobile megafauna were only recorded at the Perth Canyon Marine Park (PCMP) in the autumn, suggesting a seasonal component to their occurrence. The fine-scale distribution of pelagic taxa at the canyon head was largely stable over time, with many areas of higher relative probability of presence located outside protected zones. Despite a degree of variability that may relate to the effect of the El Niño Southern Oscillation on the Leeuwin Current, the PCMP assemblage demonstrates a relatively high degree of spatiotemporal stability. Stronger protection of the PCMP (IUCN II or higher) would potentially improve conservation outcomes for many species of pelagic wildlife.","tags":["Ecology"],"title":"True blue: Temporal and spatial stability of pelagic wildlife at a submarine canyon","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611187200,"objectID":"922f3fa709077ff38714a7f747b29a5f","permalink":"/publication/22-2021-bouchet-frontiers/","publishdate":"2021-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/22-2021-bouchet-frontiers/","section":"publication","summary":"Implementing conservation measures for data-limited species is a fundamental challenge for wildlife managers and policy-makers, and proves difficult for cryptic marine animals occurring in naturally low numbers across remote seascapes.

Such knowledge gaps curtail rigorous threat assessments on both local and regional scales. To address this and assist future conservation listings, we built the first comprehensive catalog of snubfin dolphin sightings for the Kimberley.

Forecasting the responses of biodiversity to global change has never been more important. However, many ecologists faced with limited sample sizes and shoestring budgets often resort to extrapolating predictive models beyond the range of their data to support management actions in data‐deficient contexts. This can lead to error‐prone inference that has the potential to misdirect conservation interventions and undermine decision‐making. Despite the perils associated with extrapolation, little guidance exists on the best way to identify it when it occurs, leaving users questioning how much credence they should place in model outputs. To address this, we present dsmextra, a new R package for measuring, summarising, and visualising extrapolation in multivariate environmental space. 2. dsmextra automates the process of conducting quantitative, spatially‐explicit assessments of extrapolation on the basis of two established metrics: the Extrapolation Detection (ExDet) tool, and the percentage of data nearby (%N). The package provides user‐friendly functions to (a) calculate these metrics, (b) create tabular and graphical summaries, (c) explore combinations of covariate sets as a means of informing covariate selection, and (d) produce visual displays in the form of interactive html maps. 3. dsmextra implements a model‐agnostic approach to extrapolation detection that is applicable across taxonomic groups, modelling techniques, and datasets. We present a case study fitting a density surface model to visual detections of pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) in the Gulf of Mexico. 4. Predictive modelling seeks to deliver actionable information about the states and trajectories of ecological systems, yet model performance can be strongly impaired out‐of‐sample. By assessing conditions under which models are likely to fail or succeed in extrapolating, ecologists are likely to gain a better understanding of biological patterns and their underlying drivers. Critical to this is a concerted effort to standardise best practice in model evaluation, with an emphasis on extrapolative capacity.","tags":["Ecology"],"title":"dsmextra: Extrapolation assessment tools for density surface models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593471600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593471600,"objectID":"5ec7d10bb88af8c75ec1acf06d43442c","permalink":"/publication/19-2020-bouchet-fmars/","publishdate":"2020-06-30T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/19-2020-bouchet-fmars/","section":"publication","summary":"The conservation of marine biodiversity is firmly embedded in national and international policy frameworks. However, the difficulties associated with conducting broad-scale surveys of oceanic environments restrict the evidence base available for applied management in pelagic waters. For example, the Oceanic Shoals Australian Marine Park (AMP) was established in 2012 in a part of Australia’s continental shelf where unique topographic features are thought to support significant levels of biodiversity, yet where our understanding of ecological processes remains limited. We deployed midwater baited remote underwater video systems (midwater BRUVs) in the Oceanic Shoals AMP to provide the first non-extractive baseline assessment of pelagic wildlife communities in the area. We used these observations and high-resolution multibeam swaths of the seafloor to explore potential relationships between prominent geomorphological features and the (i) composition, (ii) richness, and (iii) total abundance of pelagic communities. We documented 32 vertebrate species across three sampling areas, ranging from small baitfish to large sharks and rays, and estimated that up to twice as many taxa may occur within the region as a whole. This highlights the Oceanic Shoals AMP as a reservoir of biodiversity comparable to other documented offshore oceanic hotspots. Our results also confirm the AMP as a possible distant foraging destination for IUCN red listed sea turtles, and a potential breeding and/or nursing ground for a number of charismatic cetaceans. Model outputs indicate that both species richness and abundance increase in proximity to raised geomorphic structures such as submerged banks and pinnacles, highlighting the influence of submarine topography on megafauna distribution. By providing a foundational understanding of spatial patterns in pelagic wildlife communities throughout a little studied region, our work demonstrates how a combination of non-destructive sampling techniques and predictive models can provide new opportunities to support decision-making under data shortage.","tags":["Ecology"],"title":"Submerged carbonate banks aggregate pelagic megafauna in offshore tropical Australia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593039600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593039600,"objectID":"db764f6ca15e13d64cb9257bf9d8bf9b","permalink":"/publication/18-2020-salgado-ausmam/","publishdate":"2020-06-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/18-2020-salgado-ausmam/","section":"publication","summary":"Cetaceans are iconic predators that serve as important indicators of marine ecosystem health.

Here we combined aerial with opportunistic ship-borne surveys during 2015–2017 to describe the occurrence of multiple cetacean species on a regional scale. We used generalised estimating equations to model variation in killer whale relative density as a function of both static and dynamic covariates, including seabed depth, slope, and chlorophyll a concentration, while accounting for autocorrelation. Encountered cetacean groups included: killer (n = 177), sperm (n = 69), long-finned pilot (n = 29), false killer (n = 2), and strap-toothed beaked (n = 1) whales, as well as bottlenose (n = 12) and common (n = 5) dolphins. Killer whale numbers peaked in areas of low temperatures and high primary productivity, likely due to seasonal upwelling of nutrient-rich waters supporting high prey biomass. The best predictive model highlighted potential killer whale ‘hotspots’ in the Henry, Hood, Pallinup and Bremer Canyons.

The advent of ready‐to‐use software packages and increasing availability of digital geoinformation have considerably assisted the application of SDMs in the past decade, greatly enabling their broader use for informing conservation and management, and for quantifying impacts from global change. However, models must be fit for purpose, with all important aspects of their development and applications properly considered. Despite the widespread use of SDMs, standardisation and documentation of modelling protocols remain limited, which makes it hard to assess whether development steps are appropriate for end use. To address these issues, we propose a standard protocol for reporting SDMs, with an emphasis on describing how a study's objective is achieved through a series of modeling decisions. We call this the ODMAP (Overview, Data, Model, Assessment and Prediction) protocol, as its components reflect the main steps involved in building SDMs and other empirically‐based biodiversity models. The ODMAP protocol serves two main purposes. First, it provides a checklist for authors, detailing key steps for model building and analyses, and thus represents a quick guide and generic workflow for modern SDMs. Second, it introduces a structured format for documenting and communicating the models, ensuring transparency and reproducibility, facilitating peer review and expert evaluation of model quality, as well as meta‐analyses. We detail all elements of ODMAP, and explain how it can be used for different model objectives and applications, and how it complements efforts to store associated metadata and define modelling standards. We illustrate its utility by revisiting nine previously published case studies, and provide an interactive web‐based application to facilitate its use. We plan to advance ODMAP by encouraging its further refinement and adoption by the scientific community.","tags":["Ecology"],"title":"A standard protocol for describing species distribution models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565046000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565046000,"objectID":"c242b2ec0cfc04e8640a360b87e7c042","permalink":"/publication/16-2019-letessier-plosb/","publishdate":"2019-08-06T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/16-2019-letessier-plosb/","section":"publication","summary":"Since the 1950s, industrial fisheries have expanded globally, as fishing vessels are required to travel further afield for fishing opportunities. Technological advancements and fishery subsidies have granted ever-increasing access to populations of sharks, tunas, billfishes, and other predators. Wilderness refuges, defined here as areas beyond the detectable range of human influence, are therefore increasingly rare. In order to achieve marine resources sustainability, large no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) with pelagic components are being implemented. However, such conservation efforts require knowledge of the critical habitats for predators, both across shallow reefs and the deeper ocean. Here, we fill this gap in knowledge across the Indo-Pacific by using 1,041 midwater baited videos to survey sharks and other pelagic predators such as rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata), mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus), and black marlin (Istiompax indica). We modeled three key predator community attributes: vertebrate species richness, mean maximum body size, and shark abundance as a function of geomorphology, environmental conditions, and human pressures. All attributes were primarily driven by geomorphology (35%−62% variance explained) and environmental conditions (14%−49%). While human pressures had no influence on species richness, both body size and shark abundance responded strongly to distance to human markets (12%−20%). Refuges were identified at more than 1,250 km from human markets for body size and for shark abundance. These refuges were identified as remote and shallow seabed features, such as seamounts, submerged banks, and reefs. Worryingly, hotpots of large individuals and of shark abundance are presently under-represented within no-take MPAs that aim to effectively protect marine predators, such as the British Indian Ocean Territory. Population recovery of predators is unlikely to occur without strategic placement and effective enforcement of large no-take MPAs in both coastal and remote locations","tags":["Ecology"],"title":"Remote reefs and seamounts are the last refuges for marine predators across the Indo-Pacific","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564614000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564614000,"objectID":"9b1301ee1171e9fccf5e45ff01c41d2e","permalink":"/report/14-2019-bouchet-denmod/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/report/14-2019-bouchet-denmod/","section":"report","summary":"Density surface models (DSMs) are clearly established as a method of choice for the analysis of cetacean line transect survey data, and are increasingly used to inform risk assessments in remote marine areas subject to rising anthropogenic impacts (e.g. the high seas). However, despite persistent skepticism about the validity of extrapolated models, more and more DSMs are being applied well beyond the boundaries of the study regions where field sampling originally took place. This leads to potentially uncertain and error-prone model predictions that may mislead on-the-ground management interventions and undermine conservation decision-making. In addition, no consensus currently exists on the best way to define and measure extrapolation when it occurs, leaving users without the tools they require to audit models projected into novel conditions. Consequently, a transparent and consistent protocol for identifying scenarios under which extrapolation may be appropriate (or conversely, ill-advised) is urgently needed to better gauge how models behave outside the boundaries of sample data and to know how much faith can be placed in their outputs. This report aims to address this gap by synthesising recent advances in extrapolation detection, and presenting recommendations for a minimum standard for measuring extrapolation in novel environmental space. Such guidelines are essential to promoting transparency, replicability, and quality control, and will help marine scientists, managers and policy agencies to (i) better interpret density surfaces and their associated uncertainty; (ii) refine model development and selection approaches; and (iii) optimise the allocation of future survey effort by identifying priority knowledge gaps, e.g. by delineating areas where model predictions are the least supported by data. Our review is accompanied by supplementary R code offering a user-friendly framework for quantifying, summarising and visualising various forms of extrapolation in multivariate environmental space a priori (ahead of model fitting). We illustrate its application with case studies designed to revisit previously published predictions of sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and beaked whale (Ziphiidae spp.) densities in the Northwest Atlantic, and evaluate them in light of several extrapolation metrics. Very early in their training, ecologists are given strong warnings against extrapolating, as model predictions made in data-deficient contexts rely heavily on assumptions that may not hold outside the range of sampled conditions. Navigating the ‘uncharted waters’ of extrapolation, however, is critical to scientific progress, and will be best achieved with a clear understanding of the mechanics, benefits, and limitations of extrapolated models.","tags":[],"title":"From here and now to there and then: Practical recommendations for extrapolating cetacean density surface models to novel conditions","type":"report"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564182000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564182000,"objectID":"ee97954c2ec326a839d9a0b950f5194e","permalink":"/publication/15-2019-rendina-mer/","publishdate":"2019-07-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/15-2019-rendina-mer/","section":"publication","summary":"Climate change is leading to an increase of mean sea surface temperatures and extreme heat events. There is an urgent need to better understand the capabilities of marine macroalgae to adapt to these rapid changes. In this study, the responses of photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification to elevated temperature in a global warming scenario were investigated in the coralline alga Corallina officinalis. Algae were cultured for 7 weeks under 4 temperature treatments: (1) control under ambient-summer conditions (C, ∼20 °C), (2) simulating a one-week heatwave of 1 °C (HW, Tcontrol+1 °C), (3) elevated temperature (+3, Tcontrol +3 °C), (4) combination of the two previous treatments (HW+3, T+3+1 °C). After exposure at T+3 (up to a Tmax of ∼23 °C), respiration and photosynthesis increased significantly. After 5 weeks, calcification rates were higher at elevated temperatures (T+3 and THW+3) compared to Tcontrol, but at the end of the experiment (7 weeks) calcification decreased significantly at those temperatures beyond the thermal optimum (six-fold at T+3, and three-fold at THW+3, respectively). The same trend was noted for all the physiological processes, suggesting that a prolonged exposure to high temperatures (7 weeks up to T+3) negatively affect the physiology of C. officinalis, as a possible consequence of thermal stress. A one-week heatwave of +1 °C with respect to Tcontrol (at THW) did not affect respiration, photosynthesis, or calcification rates. Conversely, a heatwave of 1 °C, when combined with the 3 °C increase predicted by the end of the century (at THW+3), induced a reduction of physiological rates. Continued increases in both the intensity and frequency of heatwaves under anthropogenic climate change may lead to reduced growth and survival of primary producers such as C. officinalis.","tags":["Ecology","Freshwater \u0026 Marine Ecology","Marine \u0026 Freshwater Sciences","Zoology"],"title":"Physiological response of the coralline alga Corallina officinalis L. to both predicted long-term increases in temperature and short-term heatwave events","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556751600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556751600,"objectID":"4183f5ae4b33b125efa8625af2742970","permalink":"/publication/14-2019-bouchet-tree/","publishdate":"2019-05-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/14-2019-bouchet-tree/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Ecology","Freshwater \u0026 Marine Ecology","Marine \u0026 Freshwater Sciences","Zoology"],"title":"Better Model Transfers Require Knowledge of Mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554418800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554418800,"objectID":"18292fdde8e37cd7658a7fd535924319","permalink":"/publication/13-2019-przeslawski-fmars/","publishdate":"2019-04-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/13-2019-przeslawski-fmars/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the main challenges in assessing marine biodiversity is the lack of consistent approaches to monitor it. This threatens to undermine ocean best practice in marine monitoring, as it impedes a reduction in the bias and variance of sampled data and restricts the confidence in the advice that can be given. In particular, there is potential for confounding between the monitoring methods, their measured ecological properties, and the questions they seek to answer. Australia has developed significant long-term marine monitoring and observing programs and has one of the largest marine estates, including the world's largest representative network of marine parks. This new network will require ongoing monitoring and evaluation, beyond what direct funding can support, so needs to be integrated in a standardised way with other national programs to develop sufficient monitoring capacity. The aim of this paper is to describe the process undertaken in developing a suite of field manuals that provide standard operating procedures (SOPs) for marine sampling in Australian waters so that data are comparable over time and space, thereby supporting a robust, cost-effective, and objective national monitoring program.

Collaboration was a key characteristic of our approach so rather than single groups trying to impose their standards, more than 70 individuals from over 30 organisations contributed to the first version of this field manual package.","tags":null,"title":"A Suite of Field Manuals for Marine Sampling to Monitor Australian Waters","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554332400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554332400,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"/contact/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554332400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554332400,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"/home/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"cover_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554332400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554332400,"objectID":"23d1e75f872528fc12f5f2b142375ff7","permalink":"/publications/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publications/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Publications","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554332400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554332400,"objectID":"304892013014a5c2739eb2a030e66957","permalink":"/reports/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/reports/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reports","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"b9d455007af8bf0baad2ca518bab77ae","permalink":"/publication/12-2019-thompson-mbr/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/12-2019-thompson-mbr/","section":"publication","summary":"Here we describe the first underwater sighting of Shepherd's beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi). Two individuals were observed together on video footage obtained via mid-water stereo-Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS) deployed off the coast of Inaccessible Island, Tristan da Cunha, in the South Atlantic. This observation constitutes the first recorded live sighting of this species in the waters of Tristan da Cunha since 2002 and provides further evidence for the persistence of a population of this species in the region. The observed individuals lacked the dark flipper stripe observed in previous descriptions, indicating that the species may exhibit greater variation in pigmentation than previous records indicate. The planned implementation of a marine reserve in the region along with the current low level of fishing pressure and remote location of this archipelago provide a good context to ensure the appropriate management and protection of this rare species. The recent establishment of an ongoing mid-water stereo-BRUVS monitoring programme, in concert with other methods targeted at marine mammals, may yield further information about this little known species and aid in informing management decisions in the future.","tags":["Ecology","Freshwater \u0026 Marine Ecology","Marine \u0026 Freshwater Sciences","Zoology"],"title":"First underwater sighting of Shepherd's beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Monitoring its dynamics is fundamental to understanding and reporting on how the ocean is responding to human pressures and global environmental change. Increasingly stringent conservation budgets, however, are placing a strong emphasis on strategic resource allocation. Faced with mounting pressures to build accountability, managers and policy advisors must now more than ever make monitoring investment decisions that are both impactful and cost-effective. This can be challenging given the smorgasbord of modern survey tools currently available, most of which differ widely in costs, capabilities, mobilisation constraints, resolution, or sensitivity, and are evolving rapidly without always being critically evaluated or compared. Whilst pelagic waters present fascinating opportunities for ecological investigation, their extreme horizontal, vertical and temporal patchiness, as well as the huge size range of organisms inhabiting the open ocean, also pose important methodological challenges for sampling. Early pelagic studies relied heavily on capture sampling using nets. While these remain a critical component of biological and oceanographic research today, a rapidly increasing array of innovative technologies (e.g. drifting baited videography, environmental DNA, unmanned aerial vehicles) with various degrees of autonomy and sensory capabilities is revolutionising the way we quantify biophysical processes and observe wildlife in remote habitats. Protocols for choosing optimal combinations of methods for a given region, taxonomic/indicator group, or habitat remain generally unavailable. There is thus an urgent need to synthesise and compare these methods to determine how they can best support and strengthen the empirical evidence base available for implementing marine monitoring programmes. The aim of the present report is to provide a comparative assessment of commonly used pelagic sampling methods. We do this by undertaking a qualitative, yet comprehensive, review of the published literature to identify their potential advantages, limitations, and their relevance to monitoring efforts.","tags":[],"title":"Comparative assessment of pelagic sampling methods used in marine monitoring","type":"report"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522537200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522537200,"objectID":"8420fbd2454189f7dd71edf5bb23d7cf","permalink":"/report/12-2018-bouchet-fieldmanual/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/report/12-2018-bouchet-fieldmanual/","section":"report","summary":"This manual relates to gear designed to acquire digital video imagery of macro-organisms living in the ocean’s water column, from small zooplankton to marine megavertebrates.

Charismatic pelagic organisms such as cetaceans, sharks, seabirds and squid are known to concentrate in high abundance above these features. In particular, the canyons are the site of the largest reported seasonal aggregation of killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the Southern Hemisphere, with over 100 identified individuals in the local population, many of which are regularly sighted. Existing data suggest that the majority of killer whale encounters occur west of the Bremer Marine Park, around the heads of the Knob and Henry Canyons. It is unclear, however, whether this area represents a discrete and unique killer whale hotspot or whether the park may support other aggregations, be they from separate individuals or the same animals frequenting the hotspot.

Historical commercial whaling records and recent modelling studies suggest that the submarine canyons within and around the Bremer Marine Park provide favourable habitats for a number of cetaceans, including sperm, beaked, and killer whales. The latter have been reported to concentrate in unprecedented numbers in the Bremer Sub-Basin over the austral summer months, forming what is likely the largest seasonal aggregation of the species in the Southern Hemisphere. However, little data on the animals’ ecology, population abundance, or movements currently exist, and while the majority of killer whale encounters have occurred around the heads of the Knob and Henry Canyons to date, it remains unclear whether this area represents a discrete and unique hotspot or whether the Bremer Marine Park may support additional aggregations. Under the NESP Emerging Priorities scheme, the Minister for the Environment and Energy, the Honourable Josh Frydenberg MP, accordingly committed research funds to the Marine Biodiversity Hub (MBH) to assess the extent and likely drivers of the Bremer megafauna hotspot, which is currently fuelling a rapidly growing tourism industry. As part of the programme, aerial surveys were implemented to assess the presence, numbers, behaviour and distribution of large air-breathing vertebrates throughout the region. The resulting data provide a critical baseline for understanding when and how cetaceans and other charismatic predators use the Bremer Marine Park.

In the short to medium term, such knowledge is unlikely to improve greatly given the often prohibitive costs of surveying and the typically limited resources available. By forecasting biodiversity patterns in time and space, predictive models can help fill critical knowledge gaps and prioritise research to support better conservation and management. The ability of a model to predict biodiversity metrics in novel environments is termed 'transferability', and models with high transferability will be the most useful in this context. Despite their potentially broad utility, little guidance exists on what confers high transferability to biodiversity models. We synthesise recent advances in biodiversity model transfers to facilitate increased understanding of what underpins successful model transferability, demonstrating that a consistent approach has so far been lacking but is essential for achieving high levels of repeatability, transparency and accountability of model transfers.

We explored the respective contributions of environmental factors and human impacts in capturing the distribution of an assemblage of commercially valuable, large-bodied, open-water predators (tunas, marlins and mackerels). Location Western Australia. Time period 1997-2006. Major taxa studied Pelagic fishes. Methods We compiled 10 years of commercial fishing records from the Sea Around Us Project and derived relative abundance indices from standardized catch rates while accounting for confounding effects of effort, year and gear type. We used these indices to map pelagic hotspots over a 0.5°-resolution grid and built random forests to estimate the importance of 33 geophysical, oceanographic and anthropogenic predictors in explaining their locations. We additionally examined the spatial congruence between these hotspots and an extensive network of marine reserves and determined whether patterns of co-occurrence deviated from random expectations using null model simulations. Results First, we identified several pelagic hotspots off the coast of Western Australia. Second, geomorphometrics explained up to 50% of the variance in relative abundance of pelagic fishes, and submarine canyon presence ranked as the most influential variable in the North bioregion. Seafloor complexity, geodiversity, salinity, temperature variability, primary production, ocean energy, current regimes and human impacts were also identified as important predictors. Third, spatial overlap between hotspots and marine reserves was limited, with most high-abundance areas primarily found in zones where anthropogenic activities are subject to few regulations. Main conclusions This study reveals geomorphometrics as valuable indicators of the distribution of mobile fish species and highlights the relevance of harnessing static topography as a key element in any blueprint for ocean zoning and spatial management.

As a baseline to inform assessments of the impact of bycatch on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) interacting with an Australian trawl fishery, we conducted an aerial survey to estimate dolphin abundance across the fishery. Concurrently, we carried out boat-based dolphin photo-identification to assess short-term fidelity to foraging around trawlers, and used photographic and genetic data to infer longer-term fidelity to the fishery. We estimated abundance at ≈ 2,300 dolphins (95% CI = 1,247–4,214) over the ≈ 25,880-km2 fishery. Mark-recapture estimates yielded 226 (SE = 38.5) dolphins associating with one trawler and some individuals photographed up to seven times over 12 capture periods. Moreover, photographic and genetic re-sampling over three years confirmed that some individuals show long-term fidelity to trawler-associated foraging. Our study presents the first abundance estimate for any Australian pelagic dolphin community and documents individuals associating with trawlers over days, months and years. Without trend data or correction factors for dolphin availability, the impact of bycatch on this dolphin population's conservation status remains unknown. These results should be taken into account by management agencies assessing the impact of fisheries-related mortality on this protected species.","tags":null,"title":"Preliminary estimates of the abundance and fidelity of dolphins associating with a demersal trawl fishery","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493593200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493593200,"objectID":"8fe7113816268411738d780ba43b576f","permalink":"/publication/07-2017-letessier-biolrev/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/07-2017-letessier-biolrev/","section":"publication","summary":"Tuna, billfish, and oceanic sharks [hereafter referred to as ‘mobile oceanic fishes and sharks’ (MOFS)] are characterised by conservative life‐history strategies and highly migratory behaviour across large, transnational ranges. Intense exploitation over the past 65 years by a rapidly expanding high‐seas fishing fleet has left many populations depleted, with consequences at the ecosystem level due to top‐down control and trophic cascades. Despite increases in both CITES and IUCN Red Listings, the demographic trajectories of oceanic sharks and billfish are poorly quantified and resolved at geographic and population levels. Amongst MOFS trajectories, those of tunas are generally considered better understood, yet several populations remain either overfished or of unknown status. MOFS population trends and declines therefore remain contentious, partly due to challenges in deriving accurate abundance and biomass indices. Two major management strategies are currently recognised to address conservation issues surrounding MOFS: (i) internationally ratified legal frameworks and their associated regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs); and (ii) spatio‐temporal fishery closures, including no‐take marine protected areas (MPAs). In this context, we first review fishery‐dependent studies relying on data derived from catch records and from material accessible through fishing extraction, under the umbrella of RFMO‐administrated management. Challenges in interpreting catch statistics notwithstanding, we find that fishery‐dependent studies have enhanced the accuracy of biomass indices and the management strategies they inform, by addressing biases in reporting and non‐random effort, and predicting drivers of spatial variability across meso‐ and oceanic scales in order to inform stock assessments. By contrast and motivated by the increase in global MPA coverage restricting extractive activities, we then detail ways in which fishery‐independent methods are increasingly improving and steering management by exploring facets of MOFS ecology thus far poorly grasped. Advances in telemetry are increasingly used to explore ontogenic and seasonal movements, and provide means to consider MOFS migration corridors and residency patterns. The characterisation of trophic relationships and prey distribution through biochemical analysis and hydro‐acoustics surveys has enabled the tracking of dietary shifts and mapping of high‐quality foraging grounds. We conclude that while a scientific framework is available to inform initial design and subsequent implementation of MPAs, there is a shortage in the capacity to answer basic but critical questions about MOFS ecology (who, when, where?) required to track populations non‐extractively, thereby presenting a barrier to assessing empirically the performance of MPA‐based management for MOFS. This sampling gap is exacerbated by the increased establishment of large (10,000 km2) and very large MPAs (VLMPAs, 100,000 km2) ‐ great expanses of ocean lacking effective monitoring strategies and survey regimes appropriate to those scales. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate the use of a non‐extractive protocol to measure MOFS population recovery and MPA efficiency. We further identify technological avenues for monitoring at the VLMPA scale, through the use of spotter planes, drones, satellite technology, and horizontal acoustics, and highlight their relevance to the ecosystem‐based framework of MOFS management.","tags":null,"title":"Sampling mobile oceanic fishes and sharks: Implications for fisheries and conservation planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"de2d3891aa4ac3b39e61616da00d754b","permalink":"/report/08-2017-miller-d1/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/report/08-2017-miller-d1/","section":"report","summary":"This report provides detailed descriptions (metadata) of 45 Australian marine environmental datasets that have been generated and collated by the Marine Biodiversity Hub as part of Theme 3 - National Ecosystems Knowledge, Project 1 - Shelf and Canyon Ecosystems Functions and Processes. The report also includes a map for each dataset to illustrate coverage and general spatial structure. The datasets contain both marine environmental and biological variables from diverse data sources and include both new and updated information. Among them, the national bathymetry grid and derived products, seabed sediment grids, seabed exposure (GEOMACS) parameters, water quality data, the national canyon dataset and connectivity layers were produced by Geoscience Australia. Other environmental and biological datasets are the outputs of oceanographic models and collections of various governmental and research organisations. These datasets are important for the success of marine biodiversity research in Theme 3 Project 1 in that they describe key aspects of Australian marine physical, geochemical and biological environments. The physical and geochemical datasets not only characterise the static seabed features but also capture the temporal variation and three-dimensional interactions within marine ecosystems. The biological datasets represent a unique collection of fish and megafauna data available at the national scale.

The Minister for Environment and Energy, the Honourable Josh Frydenberg, committed $100,000 to the National Environmental Science Programme’s Marine Biodiversity Hub (MBH) to (1) convene a scientific workshop to design a research plan that may help answer these core questions and (2) conduct priority research in a short time frame. The October 2016, workshop participants identified two areas of priority over the short term as relevant to the needs of the Minister, namely determining the the distribution of marine mammals beyond the recognised aggregation and in relation to the Bremer CMR; and developing science communication tools to assist in decision making. Parks Australia offered an additional $50,000 to extend the survey options and communication possibilities. The NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub and Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) supported deployment of a Seaglider at the time of the aggregation. Researchers from numerous institutions including but not exclusive to the University of Western Australia (UWA), Curtin University, Marine Information and Research Group (MIRG) Australia and IMOS, conducted an array of sampling methods from February 2017, with the aim of capturing the key actions identified at the workshop.

The conservation values of these seabed features is recognised in marine bioregional plans through their assignment as Key Ecological Features (KEFs) of regional significance. These KEFs include: the carbonate banks and terraces of the Van Diemen Rise (North Marine Region); the carbonate banks and terraces of the Sahul Shelf (Northwest Marine Region), and; the pinnacles of the Bonaparte Basin (North and Northwest Marine Regions). Previous geological studies provide context for understanding the origin and distribution of modern benthic habitats within the Oceanic Shoals Marine Park. However, significant knowledge gaps around biodiversity patterns remain, with very few field observations of biota made to date in the region. A 25-day collaborative scientific voyage was undertaken by the Marine Biodiversity Hub in 2012 to sample previously unexplored carbonate terraces, banks, and pinnacles. The survey was designed to collect information to generate high-resolution seabed maps, gather samples of benthic biological material, and observe communities of fishes and other vertebrate species.","tags":[],"title":"Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve - A guide","type":"report"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"f35dd12573ceb1447aa77ee8833f250b","permalink":"/publication/06-2015-bouchet-ecosphere/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/06-2015-bouchet-ecosphere/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a novel system of drifting pelagic baited stereo-video cameras that operate in deep-water, topographically complex environments typically considered inaccessible for sampling. The instruments are portable, semi-autonomous and inexpensive, allowing the recording of high-definition video footage in near-real time and over broad stretches of ocean space. We illustrate their benefits and potential as non-extractive monitoring tools for offshore marine reserves with a pilot study conducted within the newly established Perth Canyon Commonwealth Marine Reserve, southwestern Australia (32° S, 115° E). Using occupancy and maximum entropy models, we predict the distribution of midwater fishes and sharks and show that their most suitable habitat encompasses a wider fraction of the canyon head than is covered by park boundaries. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that drifting pelagic stereo-video cameras can serve as appropriate field platforms for the construction of species distribution models with implications for ocean zoning and conservation planning efforts.","tags":["Biodiversity monitoring","Marine reserve","Marine spatial planning","Maxent","Mid-water BRUVS","Occupancy modeling","Offshore sampling","Pelagic fish and sharks","Perth canyon","Stereo-videography","Western Australia","Wildlife conservation"],"title":"Drifting baited stereo-videography: A novel sampling tool for surveying pelagic wildlife in offshore marine reserves","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"dcf08ca72a33d6c4a5746293b4b1219e","permalink":"/publication/05-2015-parsons-esr/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/05-2015-parsons-esr/","section":"publication","summary":"Limited resources and increasing environmental concerns have prompted calls to identify the critical questions that most need to be answered to advance conservation, thereby providing an agenda for scientific research priorities.

A dedicated workshop was held at the conference of the Society for Marine Mammalogy (December 2013, New Zealand) to identify where lack of data was hindering cetacean conservation and which questions need to be addressed most urgently. This paper summarizes 15 themes and component questions prioritized during the workshop. We hope this list will encourage cetacean conservation-orientated research and help agencies and policy makers to prioritize funding and future activities.

It is only with the advent of high-speed computers and the recent popularisation of geographical information systems (GIS) that terrain attributes have begun to be quantitatively measured in three-dimensional space and related to wildlife dynamics, making the well-established field of geomorphometry (or 'digital terrain modelling') a discipline of growing appeal to biologists. Although a diverse array of numerical metrics is now available to describe the shape, geometry and physical properties of natural habitats, few of these are known to, or adequately used by, ecologists. In this review, we examine the nature and usage of 56 geomorphometrics extracted from the ecological modelling literature over a period of 32 years (1979-2011). We show that, in studies of mobile predators, numerous topographic variables have largely been overlooked in favour of single basic metrics that do not, on their own, fully capture the complexity of continuous landscapes. Based on a simulation approach, we assess the redundancy and correlation structure of these metrics and demonstrate that a majority are highly collinear. We highlight a suite of 7-8 complementary metrics which best explain topographic patterns across a bathymetric grid of the west Australian seafloor, and contend that field and analytical protocols should prioritise variables of these types, particularly when the responses of predator populations to physical habitat features are of interest. We suggest that prominent structures such as canyons, seamounts or mountain chains can serve as useful proxies for predator hotspots, especially in remote locations where access to high-resolution biological data is often limited.","tags":["Aggregations","Complexity","Geomorphometry","Hotspots","Landscape","Metrics","Predators","Topography"],"title":"Topographic determinants of mobile vertebrate predator hotspots: Current knowledge and future directions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"ddc580a1e5b9deee42699c47796bf9e2","permalink":"/publication/03-2014-letessier-mbio/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/03-2014-letessier-mbio/","section":"publication","summary":"Studying sea turtles when they leave coastal areas is a particular challenge for research and conservation.

Understanding the spatial and temporal distributions of pelagic fishes and sharks is a critical component of conservation and fisheries management. Here, we report on a novel nonextractive method for the study of pelagic wildlife, based on baited stereo-camera rigs. The mid-water rigs were derived from existing methodology commonly used in demersal fish surveys. We present new data from 66 moored deployments in Shark Bay, Western Australia (26 °10 ′ S, 113 °06E) in seabed depths of up to 60 m as a demonstration of the rigs’ ability to resolve spatial variability in pelagic fish and shark assemblages, and to make accurate stereo-measurements of animal lengths. We observed 248 pelagic fishes and sharks from 27 species and 10 families and were able to distinguish between assemblages based nominally on location. We make some general recommendations on optimal deployment protocols and sampling effort regimes, based upon species accumulation rates and times of Max N (maximum number of individuals of a given species in a single video frame). Regression analyses between high quality and low quality stereo-measurements of fish fork-lengths and range were highly significant, indicating that body lengths and distance estimates were consistent even when stereomeasurements were deemed of low quality. Mid-water stereovideo camera rigs represent an efficient tool for the rapid and non-extractive monitoring of pelagic fish and shark populations, with particular relevance for application in no-take marine protected areas.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Assessing pelagic fish populations: The application of demersal video techniques to the mid-water environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"22d5d8152dd48c3c93b2dc6b8077d4c7","permalink":"/report/03-2013-nichol-oceanicshoals/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/report/03-2013-nichol-oceanicshoals/","section":"report","summary":"This report provides details of activities undertaken by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), Geoscience Australia, the University of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory during a marine biodiversity survey to the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (Timor Sea) in 2012.

The work presented in this report includes the analysis of five years of aerial survey data from North West Cape (NWC) to estimate the population size and trend. Adjoining CWR Report #2010-01 presents a comparison of results from NWC to those from Shark Bay, ~400 km south of NWC, and CMST Report #2010-16 present an analysis of sex ratio data from NWC. The population estimate was based on the application of distance sampling techniques to line transect aerial surveys conducted during 2000, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2008 at NWC. Estimates of group abundance for each survey were computed using a Horvitz-Thompson like estimator. The detection function was then fitted to the data by specifying likelihood of detection at perpendicular distances from the track line. A number of multipliers were then applied to obtain final estimates including, estimated mean group size, time period not surveyed, and a correction factor for availability (and perception bias for 2008). A variety of migration models were trialed. The modeling approach considered to have the most credible assumptions and the best fit was selected. Results from the best models indicated that the humpback whale population size was around 7,276 (CI = 4,993-10,167) in 2000, 10,548 (CI = 6,502-48,622) in 2001, 18,692 (CI = 12,980-24,477) in 2006, 20,044 (CI = 13,815-31,646) in 2007, and 26,100 (CI = 20,152-33,272) in 2008. The trend associated with these estimates that fit the data best was an exponential model with an increase rate of 14.1%. While this increase rate is considered to be above the maximum plausible increase rate of 11.8% (Zerbini et al., 2010), it is not far off from previous estimates of between 10-12%","tags":[],"title":"Southern hemisphere breeding stock 'D' humpback whale population estimates from North West cape, Western Australia","type":"report"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" dsmextra: Extrapolation tools for density surface models  dsmextra provides a toolkit for quantifying and visualising extrapolation in ecological models (with a focus on density surface models, as implemented in package dsm) projected into novel environmental space. Currently, dsmextra defines extrapolation on the basis of two metrics: (1) ExDet (Mesgaran et al. 2014), and (2) %N (the percentage of data nearby, King \u0026amp; Zeng 2007).\ndsmextra offers a variety of numerical and graphical outputs, including summary plots and interactive maps created as ggplot2 and html objects, respectively. Additional functionality (e.g. assessment methods for dynamic covariates) will be added in future releases.\nThe idea behind dsmextra is to aid ecologists, practitioners, and model end-users in identifying conditions (e.g. areas) under which predicted density surfaces may be prone to errors. In so doing, dsmextra may support:\n Better-informed interpretations of (density surface) model outputs and their associated uncertainties. Improvements to model development and covariate selection protocols. Cost-effective allocation of future survey effort towards priority, data-poor areas.

Similarly, the Zelig package (a dependency of WhatIf) was temporarily archived on 2020-03-24. As this may cause issues when first setting up dsmextra, a patch correction has been released under version 1.1.0 to ensure that WhatIf and Zelig are automatically pulled from Github during installation. Alternatively, both packages can be manually installed either from Github or from their respective archives (see here and here).\nif (!require(\u0026quot;remotes\u0026quot;)) install.packages(\u0026quot;remotes\u0026quot;) remotes::install_github(\u0026quot;IQSS/Zelig\u0026quot;) remotes::install_github(\u0026quot;IQSS/WhatIf\u0026quot;)  Found a bug?
