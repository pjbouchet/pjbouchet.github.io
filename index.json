This threatens to undermine ocean best practice in marine monitoring, as it impedes a reduction in the bias and variance of sampled data and restricts the confidence in the advice that can be given. In particular, there is potential for confounding between the monitoring methods, their measured ecological properties, and the questions they seek to answer. Australia has developed significant long-term marine monitoring and observing programs and has one of the largest marine estates, including the world's largest representative network of marine parks. This new network will require ongoing monitoring and evaluation, beyond what direct funding can support, so needs to be integrated in a standardised way with other national programs to develop sufficient monitoring capacity. The aim of this paper is to describe the process undertaken in developing a suite of field manuals that provide standard operating procedures (SOPs) for marine sampling in Australian waters so that data are comparable over time and space, thereby supporting a robust, cost-effective, and objective national monitoring program. We encourage readers to refer to the complete manuals of interest at www.nespmarine.edu.au/field-manuals. Collaboration was a key characteristic of our approach so rather than single groups trying to impose their standards, more than 70 individuals from over 30 organisations contributed to the first version of this field manual package.","tags":null,"title":"A Suite of Field Manuals for Marine Sampling to Monitor Australian Waters","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554332400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554332400,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"/contact/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554332400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554332400,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"/home/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"cover_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554332400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554332400,"objectID":"23d1e75f872528fc12f5f2b142375ff7","permalink":"/publications/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publications/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Publications","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554332400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554332400,"objectID":"304892013014a5c2739eb2a030e66957","permalink":"/reports/","publishdate":"2019-04-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/reports/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reports","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Thompson CDH","Bouchet PJ","Meeuwig JJ"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"4e25bd67ae05dab22828d2c3f88258ab","permalink":"/publication/2019-thompson-mbr/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-thompson-mbr/","section":"publication","summary":"Here we describe the first underwater sighting of Shepherd's beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi). Two individuals were observed together on video footage obtained via mid-water stereo-Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS) deployed off the coast of Inaccessible Island, Tristan da Cunha, in the South Atlantic. This observation constitutes the first recorded live sighting of this species in the waters of Tristan da Cunha since 2002 and provides further evidence for the persistence of a population of this species in the region. The observed individuals lacked the dark flipper stripe observed in previous descriptions, indicating that the species may exhibit greater variation in pigmentation than previous records indicate. The planned implementation of a marine reserve in the region along with the current low level of fishing pressure and remote location of this archipelago provide a good context to ensure the appropriate management and protection of this rare species. The recent establishment of an ongoing mid-water stereo-BRUVS monitoring programme, in concert with other methods targeted at marine mammals, may yield further information about this little known species and aid in informing management decisions in the future.","tags":["Ecology","Freshwater \u0026 Marine Ecology","Marine \u0026 Freshwater Sciences","Zoology"],"title":"First underwater sighting of Shepherd's beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Monitoring its dynamics is fundamental to understanding and reporting on how the ocean is responding to human pressures and global environmental change. Increasingly stringent conservation budgets, however, are placing a strong emphasis on strategic resource allocation. Faced with mounting pressures to build accountability, managers and policy advisors must now more than ever make monitoring investment decisions that are both impactful and cost-effective. This can be challenging given the smorgasbord of modern survey tools currently available, most of which differ widely in costs, capabilities, mobilisation constraints, resolution, or sensitivity, and are evolving rapidly without always being critically evaluated or compared. Whilst pelagic waters present fascinating opportunities for ecological investigation, their extreme horizontal, vertical and temporal patchiness, as well as the huge size range of organisms inhabiting the open ocean, also pose important methodological challenges for sampling. Early pelagic studies relied heavily on capture sampling using nets. While these remain a critical component of biological and oceanographic research today, a rapidly increasing array of innovative technologies (e.g. drifting baited videography, environmental DNA, unmanned aerial vehicles) with various degrees of autonomy and sensory capabilities is revolutionising the way we quantify biophysical processes and observe wildlife in remote habitats. Protocols for choosing optimal combinations of methods for a given region, taxonomic/indicator group, or habitat remain generally unavailable. There is thus an urgent need to synthesise and compare these methods to determine how they can best support and strengthen the empirical evidence base available for implementing marine monitoring programmes. The aim of the present report is to provide a comparative assessment of commonly used pelagic sampling methods. We do this by undertaking a qualitative, yet comprehensive, review of the published literature to identify their potential advantages, limitations, and their relevance to monitoring efforts.","tags":[],"title":"Comparative assessment of pelagic sampling methods used in marine monitoring","type":"report"},{"authors":["Bouchet PJ","Meeuwig J","Huveneers C","Langlois T","Letessier T","Lowry M","Rees M","Santana-Garcon J","Scott M","Taylor M","Thompson C","Vigliola L","Whitmarsh S"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522537200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522537200,"objectID":"28cb04b96dc04f9a5ac3633c227ee435","permalink":"/report/2018-bouchet-fieldmanual/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/report/2018-bouchet-fieldmanual/","section":"report","summary":"This manual relates to gear designed to acquire digital video imagery of macro-organisms living in the ocean’s water column, from small zooplankton to marine megavertebrates.

Charismatic pelagic organisms such as cetaceans, sharks, seabirds and squid are known to concentrate in high abundance above these features. In particular, the canyons are the site of the largest reported seasonal aggregation of killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the Southern Hemisphere, with over 100 identified individuals in the local population, many of which are regularly sighted. Existing data suggest that the majority of killer whale encounters occur west of the Bremer Marine Park, around the heads of the Knob and Henry Canyons. It is unclear, however, whether this area represents a discrete and unique killer whale hotspot or whether the park may support other aggregations, be they from separate individuals or the same animals frequenting the hotspot.

Historical commercial whaling records and recent modelling studies suggest that the submarine canyons within and around the Bremer Marine Park provide favourable habitats for a number of cetaceans, including sperm, beaked, and killer whales. The latter have been reported to concentrate in unprecedented numbers in the Bremer Sub-Basin over the austral summer months, forming what is likely the largest seasonal aggregation of the species in the Southern Hemisphere. However, little data on the animals’ ecology, population abundance, or movements currently exist, and while the majority of killer whale encounters have occurred around the heads of the Knob and Henry Canyons to date, it remains unclear whether this area represents a discrete and unique hotspot or whether the Bremer Marine Park may support additional aggregations. Under the NESP Emerging Priorities scheme, the Minister for the Environment and Energy, the Honourable Josh Frydenberg MP, accordingly committed research funds to the Marine Biodiversity Hub (MBH) to assess the extent and likely drivers of the Bremer megafauna hotspot, which is currently fuelling a rapidly growing tourism industry. As part of the programme, aerial surveys were implemented to assess the presence, numbers, behaviour and distribution of large air-breathing vertebrates throughout the region. The resulting data provide a critical baseline for understanding when and how cetaceans and other charismatic predators use the Bremer Marine Park. Such knowledge is key to helping managers and policy-makers meet national legislative requirements regarding the adequate conservation of Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) listed species.","tags":[],"title":"Aerial visual survey of cetaceans and other megafauna in the Bremer Marine Park and surrounding areas","type":"report"},{"authors":["Sequeira AMM","Bouchet PJ","Yates KL","Mengersen K","Caley JM"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"d9ef7c29a52d02675ab558a0bcb664c7","permalink":"/publication/2018-sequeira-mee/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-sequeira-mee/","section":"publication","summary":"After decades of extensive surveying, knowledge of the global distribution of species still remains inadequate for many purposes. In the short to medium term, such knowledge is unlikely to improve greatly given the often prohibitive costs of surveying and the typically limited resources available. By forecasting biodiversity patterns in time and space, predictive models can help fill critical knowledge gaps and prioritise research to support better conservation and management. The ability of a model to predict biodiversity metrics in novel environments is termed 'transferability', and models with high transferability will be the most useful in this context. Despite their potentially broad utility, little guidance exists on what confers high transferability to biodiversity models. We synthesise recent advances in biodiversity model transfers to facilitate increased understanding of what underpins successful model transferability, demonstrating that a consistent approach has so far been lacking but is essential for achieving high levels of repeatability, transparency and accountability of model transfers. We provide a set of guidelines to support efficient learning and the improvement of model transferability.","tags":null,"title":"Transferring biodiversity models for conservation: Opportunities and challenges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bouchet PJ","Meeuwig JJ","Huang Z","Letessier TBL","Nichol SL","Caley MJ","Watson RA"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503529200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503529200,"objectID":"4fcce74475350bc295982fa544e4507a","permalink":"/publication/2018-bouchet-geb/","publishdate":"2017-08-24T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-bouchet-geb/","section":"publication","summary":"Aim Protected areas have become pivotal to the modern conservation planning toolbox, but a limited understanding of marine macroecology is hampering their efficient design and implementation in pelagic environments. We explored the respective contributions of environmental factors and human impacts in capturing the distribution of an assemblage of commercially valuable, large-bodied, open-water predators (tunas, marlins and mackerels). Location Western Australia. Time period 1997-2006. Major taxa studied Pelagic fishes. Methods We compiled 10 years of commercial fishing records from the Sea Around Us Project and derived relative abundance indices from standardized catch rates while accounting for confounding effects of effort, year and gear type. We used these indices to map pelagic hotspots over a 0.5°-resolution grid and built random forests to estimate the importance of 33 geophysical, oceanographic and anthropogenic predictors in explaining their locations. We additionally examined the spatial congruence between these hotspots and an extensive network of marine reserves and determined whether patterns of co-occurrence deviated from random expectations using null model simulations. Results First, we identified several pelagic hotspots off the coast of Western Australia. Second, geomorphometrics explained up to 50% of the variance in relative abundance of pelagic fishes, and submarine canyon presence ranked as the most influential variable in the North bioregion. Seafloor complexity, geodiversity, salinity, temperature variability, primary production, ocean energy, current regimes and human impacts were also identified as important predictors. Third, spatial overlap between hotspots and marine reserves was limited, with most high-abundance areas primarily found in zones where anthropogenic activities are subject to few regulations. Main conclusions This study reveals geomorphometrics as valuable indicators of the distribution of mobile fish species and highlights the relevance of harnessing static topography as a key element in any blueprint for ocean zoning and spatial management.

Concurrently, we carried out boat-based dolphin photo-identification to assess short-term fidelity to foraging around trawlers, and used photographic and genetic data to infer longer-term fidelity to the fishery. We estimated abundance at ≈ 2,300 dolphins (95% CI = 1,247–4,214) over the ≈ 25,880-km2 fishery. Mark-recapture estimates yielded 226 (SE = 38.5) dolphins associating with one trawler and some individuals photographed up to seven times over 12 capture periods. Moreover, photographic and genetic re-sampling over three years confirmed that some individuals show long-term fidelity to trawler-associated foraging. Our study presents the first abundance estimate for any Australian pelagic dolphin community and documents individuals associating with trawlers over days, months and years. Without trend data or correction factors for dolphin availability, the impact of bycatch on this dolphin population's conservation status remains unknown. These results should be taken into account by management agencies assessing the impact of fisheries-related mortality on this protected species.","tags":null,"title":"Preliminary estimates of the abundance and fidelity of dolphins associating with a demersal trawl fishery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Letessier TB","Bouchet PJ","Meeuwig JJ"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493593200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493593200,"objectID":"eb38a3777d73425d979df44884f7c5c7","permalink":"/publication/2017-letessier-biolrev/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-letessier-biolrev/","section":"publication","summary":"Tuna, billfish, and oceanic sharks [hereafter referred to as ‘mobile oceanic fishes and sharks’ (MOFS)] are characterised by conservative life‐history strategies and highly migratory behaviour across large, transnational ranges. Intense exploitation over the past 65 years by a rapidly expanding high‐seas fishing fleet has left many populations depleted, with consequences at the ecosystem level due to top‐down control and trophic cascades. Despite increases in both CITES and IUCN Red Listings, the demographic trajectories of oceanic sharks and billfish are poorly quantified and resolved at geographic and population levels. Amongst MOFS trajectories, those of tunas are generally considered better understood, yet several populations remain either overfished or of unknown status. MOFS population trends and declines therefore remain contentious, partly due to challenges in deriving accurate abundance and biomass indices. Two major management strategies are currently recognised to address conservation issues surrounding MOFS: (i) internationally ratified legal frameworks and their associated regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs); and (ii) spatio‐temporal fishery closures, including no‐take marine protected areas (MPAs). In this context, we first review fishery‐dependent studies relying on data derived from catch records and from material accessible through fishing extraction, under the umbrella of RFMO‐administrated management. Challenges in interpreting catch statistics notwithstanding, we find that fishery‐dependent studies have enhanced the accuracy of biomass indices and the management strategies they inform, by addressing biases in reporting and non‐random effort, and predicting drivers of spatial variability across meso‐ and oceanic scales in order to inform stock assessments. By contrast and motivated by the increase in global MPA coverage restricting extractive activities, we then detail ways in which fishery‐independent methods are increasingly improving and steering management by exploring facets of MOFS ecology thus far poorly grasped. Advances in telemetry are increasingly used to explore ontogenic and seasonal movements, and provide means to consider MOFS migration corridors and residency patterns. The characterisation of trophic relationships and prey distribution through biochemical analysis and hydro‐acoustics surveys has enabled the tracking of dietary shifts and mapping of high‐quality foraging grounds. We conclude that while a scientific framework is available to inform initial design and subsequent implementation of MPAs, there is a shortage in the capacity to answer basic but critical questions about MOFS ecology (who, when, where?) required to track populations non‐extractively, thereby presenting a barrier to assessing empirically the performance of MPA‐based management for MOFS. This sampling gap is exacerbated by the increased establishment of large (10,000 km2) and very large MPAs (VLMPAs, 100,000 km2) ‐ great expanses of ocean lacking effective monitoring strategies and survey regimes appropriate to those scales. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate the use of a non‐extractive protocol to measure MOFS population recovery and MPA efficiency. We further identify technological avenues for monitoring at the VLMPA scale, through the use of spotter planes, drones, satellite technology, and horizontal acoustics, and highlight their relevance to the ecosystem‐based framework of MOFS management.","tags":null,"title":"Sampling mobile oceanic fishes and sharks: Implications for fisheries and conservation planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miller K","Puotinen M","Przeslawski R","Huang Z","Bouchet PJ","Radford B","Li J","Kool J","Picard K","Thums M","Meeuwig J","Nichol S"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"c0bc53a9d74bbd73e25fd6cd2e8f6e4a","permalink":"/report/2017-miller-d1/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/report/2017-miller-d1/","section":"report","summary":"This report provides detailed descriptions (metadata) of 45 Australian marine environmental datasets that have been generated and collated by the Marine Biodiversity Hub as part of Theme 3 - National Ecosystems Knowledge, Project 1 - Shelf and Canyon Ecosystems Functions and Processes. The report also includes a map for each dataset to illustrate coverage and general spatial structure. The datasets contain both marine environmental and biological variables from diverse data sources and include both new and updated information. Among them, the national bathymetry grid and derived products, seabed sediment grids, seabed exposure (GEOMACS) parameters, water quality data, the national canyon dataset and connectivity layers were produced by Geoscience Australia. Other environmental and biological datasets are the outputs of oceanographic models and collections of various governmental and research organisations. These datasets are important for the success of marine biodiversity research in Theme 3 Project 1 in that they describe key aspects of Australian marine physical, geochemical and biological environments. The physical and geochemical datasets not only characterise the static seabed features but also capture the temporal variation and three-dimensional interactions within marine ecosystems. The biological datasets represent a unique collection of fish and megafauna data available at the national scale. Together, these marine environmental datasets enhance our understanding of large-scale ecological processes driving marine biodiversity patterns. However, we should be aware of the uncertainties and potential errors exist in these datasets due to limitations of data collection and processing methods. Data quality issues of individual datasets have been documented in this report where possible.","tags":[],"title":"NESP Project D1 Ecosystem understanding to support sustainable use, management and monitoring of marine assets in the North and North-West regions - Final Report 2016","type":"report"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461711600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461711600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The Minister for Environment and Energy, the Honourable Josh Frydenberg, committed $100,000 to the National Environmental Science Programme’s Marine Biodiversity Hub (MBH) to (1) convene a scientific workshop to design a research plan that may help answer these core questions and (2) conduct priority research in a short time frame. The October 2016, workshop participants identified two areas of priority over the short term as relevant to the needs of the Minister, namely determining the the distribution of marine mammals beyond the recognised aggregation and in relation to the Bremer CMR; and developing science communication tools to assist in decision making. Parks Australia offered an additional $50,000 to extend the survey options and communication possibilities. The NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub and Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) supported deployment of a Seaglider at the time of the aggregation. Researchers from numerous institutions including but not exclusive to the University of Western Australia (UWA), Curtin University, Marine Information and Research Group (MIRG) Australia and IMOS, conducted an array of sampling methods from February 2017, with the aim of capturing the key actions identified at the workshop. This report summarises the current outcomes of these research programs.","tags":[],"title":"Bremer Canyon Science Report: Workshop held 25 October 2016","type":"report"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

These KEFs include: the carbonate banks and terraces of the Van Diemen Rise (North Marine Region); the carbonate banks and terraces of the Sahul Shelf (Northwest Marine Region), and; the pinnacles of the Bonaparte Basin (North and Northwest Marine Regions). Previous geological studies provide context for understanding the origin and distribution of modern benthic habitats within the Oceanic Shoals Marine Park. However, significant knowledge gaps around biodiversity patterns remain, with very few field observations of biota made to date in the region. A 25-day collaborative scientific voyage was undertaken by the Marine Biodiversity Hub in 2012 to sample previously unexplored carbonate terraces, banks, and pinnacles.

It is only with the advent of high-speed computers and the recent popularisation of geographical information systems (GIS) that terrain attributes have begun to be quantitatively measured in three-dimensional space and related to wildlife dynamics, making the well-established field of geomorphometry (or 'digital terrain modelling') a discipline of growing appeal to biologists. Although a diverse array of numerical metrics is now available to describe the shape, geometry and physical properties of natural habitats, few of these are known to, or adequately used by, ecologists. In this review, we examine the nature and usage of 56 geomorphometrics extracted from the ecological modelling literature over a period of 32 years (1979-2011). We show that, in studies of mobile predators, numerous topographic variables have largely been overlooked in favour of single basic metrics that do not, on their own, fully capture the complexity of continuous landscapes. Based on a simulation approach, we assess the redundancy and correlation structure of these metrics and demonstrate that a majority are highly collinear. We highlight a suite of 7-8 complementary metrics which best explain topographic patterns across a bathymetric grid of the west Australian seafloor, and contend that field and analytical protocols should prioritise variables of these types, particularly when the responses of predator populations to physical habitat features are of interest. We suggest that prominent structures such as canyons, seamounts or mountain chains can serve as useful proxies for predator hotspots, especially in remote locations where access to high-resolution biological data is often limited.","tags":["Aggregations","Complexity","Geomorphometry","Hotspots","Landscape","Metrics","Predators","Topography"],"title":"Topographic determinants of mobile vertebrate predator hotspots: Current knowledge and future directions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Letessier TBL","Bouchet PJ","Reisser J","Meeuwig JJ"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"7081865de61c2da61ffa43c4fd31295e","permalink":"/publication/2014-letessier-mbio/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-letessier-mbio/","section":"publication","summary":"Studying sea turtles when they leave coastal areas is a particular challenge for research and conservation. As part of a large-scale fish monitoring programme, we have deployed mid-water stereo baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS, Letessier et al. 2013) at 181 sites around northwestern Australia. From 27 turtle observations, we identified 11 green turtles (Chelonia mydas) around Dirk Hartog Island, west of Shark Bay (April 2012) and three olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) on the Australian shelf of the Timor Sea (September 2012, Fig. 1). Turtle encounter rates were 37 % inside the shallow Dirk Hartog pass (mean depth 11 m) compared with 0 % on the seaward side of the island, and 2.5 % in the Timor Sea (mean depth 113 m). Straight carapace length (SCL) was measured for one olive ridley (70.0 cm, an adult female) and four green turtles (SCL =40.6–89.5 cm). At least two olive ridleys and three greens actively inspected the bait (see electronic supplementary material).","tags":null,"title":"Baited videography reveals remote foraging and migration behaviour of sea turtles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huang Z","Przeslawski R","Kool J","Li J","Bouchet PJ","Nichol S"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1359676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1359676800,"objectID":"68bfd35d1aa6cf45f3910a04fe69b1df","permalink":"/report/2013-huang-metadata/","publishdate":"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/report/2013-huang-metadata/","section":"report","summary":"This report provides detailed descriptions (metadata) of 45 Australian marine environmental datasets that have been generated and collated by the Marine Biodiversity Hub as part of Theme 3 - National Ecosystems Knowledge, Project 1 - Shelf and Canyon Ecosystems Functions and Processes. The report also includes a map for each dataset to illustrate coverage and general spatial structure. The datasets contain both marine environmental and biological variables from diverse data sources and include both new and updated information. Among them, the national bathymetry grid and derived products, seabed sediment grids, seabed exposure (GEOMACS) parameters, water quality data, the national canyon dataset and connectivity layers were produced by Geoscience Australia. Other environmental and biological datasets are the outputs of oceanographic models and collections of various governmental and research organisations. These datasets are important for the success of marine biodiversity research in Theme 3 Project 1 in that they describe key aspects of Australian marine physical, geochemical and biological environments. The physical and geochemical datasets not only characterise the static seabed features but also capture the temporal variation and three-dimensional interactions within marine ecosystems. The biological datasets represent a unique collection of fish and megafauna data available at the national scale. Together, these marine environmental datasets enhance our understanding of large-scale ecological processes driving marine biodiversity patterns. However, we should be aware of the uncertainties and potential errors exist in these datasets due to limitations of data collection and processing methods. Data quality issues of individual datasets have been documented in this report where possible.","tags":[],"title":"Australian marine environmental data: Descriptions and metadata","type":"report"},{"authors":["Letessier TB","Meeuwig JJ","Gollock M","Groves L","Bouchet PJ","Chapuis L","Vianna G","Kemp K","Koldewey H"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"8b7f1815b10f7b90d9cca849dd736dac","permalink":"/publication/2013-letessier-mo/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-letessier-mo/","section":"publication","summary":"In the open ocean, the movements and habitat use of large mobile predators are driven by dynamic interactions between biological and physical variables and complex predator–prey relationships. Understanding the spatial and temporal distributions of pelagic fishes and sharks is a critical component of conservation and fisheries management. Here, we report on a novel nonextractive method for the study of pelagic wildlife, based on baited stereo-camera rigs. The mid-water rigs were derived from existing methodology commonly used in demersal fish surveys. We present new data from 66 moored deployments in Shark Bay, Western Australia (26 °10 ′ S, 113 °06E) in seabed depths of up to 60 m as a demonstration of the rigs’ ability to resolve spatial variability in pelagic fish and shark assemblages, and to make accurate stereo-measurements of animal lengths. We observed 248 pelagic fishes and sharks from 27 species and 10 families and were able to distinguish between assemblages based nominally on location. We make some general recommendations on optimal deployment protocols and sampling effort regimes, based upon species accumulation rates and times of Max N (maximum number of individuals of a given species in a single video frame). Regression analyses between high quality and low quality stereo-measurements of fish fork-lengths and range were highly significant, indicating that body lengths and distance estimates were consistent even when stereomeasurements were deemed of low quality. Mid-water stereovideo camera rigs represent an efficient tool for the rapid and non-extractive monitoring of pelagic fish and shark populations, with particular relevance for application in no-take marine protected areas.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Assessing pelagic fish populations: The application of demersal video techniques to the mid-water environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nichol SL","Howard FJF","Kool J","Stowar M","Bouchet PJ","Radke L","Siwabessy J","Przeslawski R","Picard K","Alvarez de Glasby B","Colquhoun J","Letessier T","Heyward A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"1fb9cc0e8f9bbc504e9a321d624454d5","permalink":"/report/2013-nichol-oceanicshoals/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/report/2013-nichol-oceanicshoals/","section":"report","summary":"This report provides details of activities undertaken by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), Geoscience Australia, the University of Western Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory during a marine biodiversity survey to the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (Timor Sea) in 2012.
