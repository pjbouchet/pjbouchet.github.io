      <description>Extrapolation tools for density surface models    dsmextra provides a toolkit for quantifying and visualising extrapolation in ecological models (with a focus on density surface models, as implemented in package dsm) projected into novel environmental space. Currently, dsmextra defines extrapolation on the basis of two metrics: (1) ExDet (Mesgaran et al. 2014), and (2) %N (the percentage of data nearby, King &amp;amp; Zeng 2007).
dsmextra offers a variety of numerical and graphical outputs, including summary plots and interactive maps created as ggplot2 and html objects, respectively.</description>
